Critical Point Behavior
=======================

To create this project, the code should have been followed until the Monte Carlo
insert part.

The goal is to use the Monte Carlo code to explore the behavior of a
Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid near its critical point. The critical point is
where the liquid and vapor phases become indistinguishable, and the fluid exhibits
unique thermodynamic properties, such as large fluctuations in density and a
divergence in certain response functions like the compressibility.
