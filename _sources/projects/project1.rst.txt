Equation of state
=================

To create this project, the code should have been followed until the Monte Carlo
displace part.

The Equation of State (EoS) is a fundamental relationship in thermodynamics and
statistical mechanics that describes how the state variables of a system, such as
pressure p, volume V, and temperature T, are interrelated.

Here, the results obtained by Wood and Parker in one of the first article
published on Monte Carlo simulations :cite:`woodMonteCarloEquation1957`. Just like
Wood and Parker, our results will be compared to experimental observations of
Michels on argon gas :cite:`michels1949isotherms`.
