   By following Learn Molecular Simulations with Python, you will write a simple Python
   code containing the most basic functionalities of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo
   simulations. The main goals are (1) to help users understand molecular simulation
   algorithms and (2) to use the script for small scientific projects. The target
   audience includes people completely new to molecular simulations, as well as users
   of black-box codes such as LAMMPS and GROMACS.

   Although some prior knowledge of coding and statistical physics would be useful, 
   Learn Molecular Simulations with Python can be followed by anyone with a computer.
   Annexes with key concepts and suggested readings are provided when necessary.
