Initialize the simulation
=========================

Here, the *InitializeSimulation* class is created. This class is used to
prepare the simulation box and populate the box with atoms.

Simulation box
--------------

In all the simulations performed here, a certain number of atoms are first 
randomly placed in a 3D cuboid box.

Start coding
------------

Let us improve the previously created *InitializeSimulation* class. Remember that
the InitializeSimulation class inherits the *Prepare* class.

.. label:: start_InitializeSimulation_class

.. code-block:: python

    class InitializeSimulation(Prepare):
        def __init__(self,
                    box_dimensions=[10, 10, 10],  # List - Angstroms
                    seed=None,  # Int
                    initial_positions=None,  # Array - Angstroms
                    *args,
                    **kwargs,
                    ):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.box_dimensions = box_dimensions
            self.dimensions = len(box_dimensions)
            self.seed = seed
            self.initial_positions = initial_positions

.. label:: end_InitializeSimulation_class

Three parameters are provided to the *InitializeSimulation* class. THe first one
is the box dimensions, *box_dimensions*, which is a list with a length corresponding to
the dimension of the system. The *dimensions* is calculated as the length of *box_dimensions*.
Each element of the list correspond to a dimension of the box in Ångström in the x, y, and
z directions, respectively. A seed is also provided as a parameter (an integer), as well as some initial
positions for the atoms that can be provided as an array of length corresponding
to the number of atoms, and a number of columns corresponding to *dimensions*. If
*initial_positions* is left equal to *None*, positions will be randomly attributed
to the atoms, see below.

Provide a seed
--------------

A *seed* can be provided to launch the *exact* same simulations (i.e. same atom positions,
same atom velocities) several times in a row, which is useful during debugging. Add
the following *if* condition to the *__init__()* method:

.. label:: start_InitializeSimulation_class

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self,
        (...)
        self.initial_positions = initial_positions
        if self.seed is not None:
            np.random.seed(self.seed)

.. label:: end_InitializeSimulation_class

If a *seed* is provided, it is passed to the *random.seed()* function of *NumPy*.
If *seed* is left to its default value of *None*, the simulation will be randomized.

Nondimensionalize units
-----------------------

Just like we did in the pervious chapter, let us nondimensionalize the provided
parameters, here the box_dimensions.

..
    (S.G. TOFIX: what about initial_positions? It should be nondimensionalized too.

.. label:: start_InitializeSimulation_class

.. code-block:: python

    def nondimensionalize_units_1(self):
        """Use LJ prefactors to convert units into non-dimensional."""
        # Normalize box dimensions
        box_dimensions = []
        for L in self.box_dimensions:
            box_dimensions.append(L/self.reference_distance)
        self.box_dimensions = box_dimensions

.. label:: end_InitializeSimulation_class

Define the box
--------------

Let us define a box from the *box_dimensions* list. Add the following method
to the InitializeSimulation class:

.. label:: start_InitializeSimulation_class

.. code-block:: python

    def define_box(self):
        box_boundaries = np.zeros((self.dimensions, 2))
        for dim, L in zip(range(self.dimensions), self.box_dimensions):
            box_boundaries[dim] = -L/2, L/2
        self.box_boundaries = box_boundaries
        box_size = np.diff(self.box_boundaries).reshape(3)
        box_geometry = np.array([90, 90, 90])
        self.box_size = np.array(box_size.tolist()+box_geometry.tolist())

.. label:: end_InitializeSimulation_class

The *box_boundaries* are calculated from the *box_dimensions*. It corresponds to
the lowest and highest coordinate in all directions. By symmetry, the box is centered
in 0 for all axes. A *box_size* is also defined. It follows the MDAnalysis
conventions: Lx, Ly, Lz, 90, 90, 90, where the last three numbers are angles in
degrees. Values different from *90* for the angles would define a triclinic
(non-orthogonal) boxe, which is not currently supported by the current code.

Populate the box
----------------

Here, the atoms are placed within the simulation box. If initial
positions were not provided (i.e. *initial_positions = None*), atoms
are placed randomly within the box. If initial positions were provided
as an array named *initial_positions*, they are used instead. Note that in that
case, the array number be of size 'number of atoms' x ''number of dimensions.

.. label:: start_InitializeSimulation_class

.. code-block:: python

    def populate_box(self):
        if self.initial_positions is None:
            atoms_positions = np.zeros((self.total_number_atoms,
                                        self.dimensions))
            for dim in np.arange(self.dimensions):
                diff_box = np.diff(self.box_boundaries[dim])
                random_pos = np.random.random(self.total_number_atoms)
                atoms_positions[:, dim] = random_pos*diff_box-diff_box/2
            self.atoms_positions = atoms_positions
        else:
            self.atoms_positions = self.initial_positions

.. label:: end_InitializeSimulation_class

In case initial positions were not provided by the user, and array of size
total_number_atoms x dimensions is created, random positions are defined
using the random function of NumPy.

Here, the newly added atoms are added randomly within the box, without taking care
of avoiding any overlap with existing atoms.

Finally, let us call the methods from the *__init__* class:

.. label:: start_InitializeSimulation_class

.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self,
        (...)
        self.initial_positions = initial_positions
        if self.seed is not None:
            np.random.seed(self.seed)
        self.nondimensionalize_units_1()
        self.define_box()
        self.populate_box()

.. label:: end_InitializeSimulation_class

Test the code
-------------

Let us test the *InitializeSimulation* class to make sure that it does what
is expected, i.e. that it does create a simulation box of desired size and
attribute positions to the atoms.

.. label:: start_test_InitializeSimulation_class

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from InitializeSimulation import InitializeSimulation

    init = InitializeSimulation(number_atoms=[2, 3],
        epsilon=[0.1, 1.0], # kcal/mol
        sigma=[3, 6], # A
        atom_mass=[1, 1], # g/mol
        box_dimensions=[20, 20, 20], # A
        seed=48031,
        )

    for d in range(3):
        assert np.round(init.box_size[d],3) == np.round(20/3,3)
    assert np.shape(init.atoms_positions) == (init.total_number_atoms, 3)
    for d in range(3):
        assert init.atoms_positions[0][d] >= init.box_boundaries[0][0]
        assert init.atoms_positions[0][d] <= init.box_boundaries[0][1]

.. label:: end_test_InitializeSimulation_class

The first assert statement ensures that the box size has the expected size along
all 3 dimensions of space, in normalised units.
The second assert ensures that the size of the created *atoms_positions* array
is consistent with the anumber of atoms. The third assert ensures that the created
atoms are located within the box boundaries along all 3 dimensions of space.
